Here is my forecast: 

Democrats take the house easily.
Republicans maintain Senate, with both parties seeing incumbents lose.  

Stacey Abrams wins Governor in Georgia. 
VT Governor will stay GOP with Scott (R).
Gillum wins Gov in Florida. 
Jealous loses in MD.

Some fly-over states that went to Trump in 2016 will switch Blue in Senate (Michigan, Montana, Minnesota, Indiana). However, losses in the South as a result of immigration concerns keep the Senate in GOP hands. 
Arizona goes to McSally.
Beto loses to Cruz in Texas.
